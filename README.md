# DeepRaman

Raman spectra contain abundant information from molecules but are difficult to analyze, especially for the mixtures. In this study, a method entitled DeepRaman has been proposed to solve this problems. Essentially, it is a pseudo-Siamese neural network (pSNN) with spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) to predict component(s) in an unknown sample by comparing their Raman spectra. DeepRaman obtains promising results for the analysis of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) dataset of artificial sweeteners and Raman imaging dataset of gunpowder. Together, it is an accurate, universal and ready-to-use method for spectral matching and compound identification in various application scenarios.
